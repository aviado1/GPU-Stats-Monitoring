# GPU Stats Monitoring

## Overview
This PowerShell script (`GPUStatsMonitor.ps1`) is designed to monitor GPU statistics remotely using the Posh-SSH module. It retrieves detailed GPU information including the GPU index, name, load percentage, memory usage, and temperature from a remote server. The script displays these statistics in the console with visual bars that vary in color based on the usage levelâ€”making it highly readable and informative.

## Features

- **Memory Usage**: Shows memory usage in MiB, also represented with a color-coded bar.
- **Temperature**: Reports the GPU temperature in Celsius with visual representation.
- **Automatic Refresh**: Updates GPU stats every 5 seconds to provide real-time monitoring.

1. Ensure that the Posh-SSH module is installed in your PowerShell environment.
2. Set the server IP address, username, and password in the script.
